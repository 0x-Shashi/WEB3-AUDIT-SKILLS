## Summary

The deposit / withdraw / trade transaction lack of expiration timestamp and slippage control

## Vulnerability Detail

Let us look into the heavily forked Uniswap V2 contract addLiquidity function implementation

https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L61

```solidity
// **** ADD LIQUIDITY ****
function _addLiquidity(
	address tokenA,
	address tokenB,
	uint amountADesired,
	uint amountBDesired,
	uint amountAMin,
	uint amountBMin
) internal virtual returns (uint amountA, uint amountB) {
	// create the pair if it doesn't exist yet
	if (IUniswapV2Factory(factory).getPair(tokenA, tokenB) == address(0)) {
		IUniswapV2Factory(factory).createPair(tokenA, tokenB);
	}
	(uint reserveA, uint reserveB) = UniswapV2Library.getReserves(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
	if (reserveA == 0 && reserveB == 0) {
		(amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBDesired);
	} else {
		uint amountBOptimal = UniswapV2Library.quote(amountADesired, reserveA, reserveB);
		if (amountBOptimal <= amountBDesired) {
			require(amountBOptimal >= amountBMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_B_AMOUNT');
			(amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBOptimal);
		} else {
			uint amountAOptimal = UniswapV2Library.quote(amountBDesired, reserveB, reserveA);
			assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired);
			require(amountAOptimal >= amountAMin

### Example 2: H-14: Deadline check is not effective, allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be unexpected executed

**Source**: Sherlock
**Protocol**: Blueberry Update
**Impact**: HIGH

**Details**:

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry-judging/issues/145 

## Found by 
Bauer, Breeje, ctf\_sec
## Summary

Deadline check is not effective, allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be unexpected executed

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation in CurveSpell.sol

```solidity
{
	// 2. Swap rewards tokens to debt token
	uint256 rewards = _doCutRewardsFee(CRV);
	_ensureApprove(CRV, address(swapRouter), rewards);
	swapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
		rewards,
		0,
		swapPath,
		address(this),
		type(uint256).max
	);
}
```

the deadline check is set to type(uint256).max, which means the deadline check is disabled!

In IChiSpell. the swap is directedly call on the pool instead of the router

```solidity
SWAP_POOL.swap(
	address(this),
	// if withdraw token is Token0, then swap token1 -> token0 (false)
	!isTokenA,
	amountToSwap.toInt256(),
	isTokenA
		? param.sqrtRatioLimit + deltaSqrt
		: param.sqrtRatioLimit - deltaSqrt, // slippaged price cap
	abi.encode(address(this))
);
```

and it has no deadline check for the transaction when swapping

## Impact

AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades:

Alice wants to swap 100 tokens for 1 ETH and

### Example 3: [M-02] Dangerous use of deadline parameter

**Source**: Code4rena
**Protocol**: Particle Protocol
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**Details**:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-particle/blob/a3af40839b24aa13f5764d4f84933dbfa8bc8134/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L197>

The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the deadline argument while interacting with the Uniswap NFT Position Manager, which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.

### Impact

Actions in the Uniswap NonfungiblePositionManager contract are protected by a `deadline` parameter to limit the execution of pending transactions. Functions that modify the liquidity of the pool check this parameter against the current block timestamp in order to discard expired actions.

These interactions with the Uniswap position are present in the LiquidityPosition library. The functions `mint()`, `increaseLiquidity()` and `decreaseLiquidity()` call their corresponding functions in the Uniswap Position Manager, providing `block.timestamp` as the argument for the `deadline` parameter:

```solidity
131:         // mint the position
132:         (tokenId, liquidity, amount0Minted, amount1Minted) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MA

### Example 5: [M-01] Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

**Source**: Code4rena
**Protocol**: Backed Protocol
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**Details**:

<https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol#L208>

<https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol#L182>

### Summary

The `PaprController` contract does not allow users to submit a deadline for their actions which execute swaps on Uniswap V3. This missing feature enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point.

### Detailed description

AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229) and [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L119)). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades:

1.  Alice wants to swap 100 `tokens` for 1 `ETH` and later sell the 1 `ETH` for 1000 `DAI`.
2.  The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, Alice chose a transaction fee that is too low for miners to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
3.  When the average gas fee dropped far enough for
