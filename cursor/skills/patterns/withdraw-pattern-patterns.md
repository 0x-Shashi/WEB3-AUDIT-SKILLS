## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: H-8: Interest component of underlying amount is not withdrawable using the `withdrawLend` function. Such amount is permanently locked in the BlueBerryBank contract

**Source**: Sherlock
**Protocol**: Blueberry
**Impact**: HIGH

## Summary
Soft vault shares are issued against interest bearing tokens issued by `Compound` protocol in exchange for underlying deposits. However, `withdrawLend` function caps the withdrawable amount to initial underlying deposited by user (`pos.underlyingAmount`). Capping underlying amount to initial underlying deposited would mean that a user can burn all his vault shares in `withdrawLend` function and only receive original underlying deposited.

Interest accrued component received from Soft vault (that rightfully belongs to the user) is no longer retrievable because the underlying vault shares are already burnt. Loss to the users is permanent as such interest amount sits permanently locked in Blueberry bank.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`withdrawLend` function in `BlueBerryBank`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry/blob/main/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L669) allows users to withdraw underlying amount from `Hard` or `Soft` vaults. `Soft` vault shares are backed by interest bearing `cTokens` issued by Compound Protocol

User can request underlying by specifying `shareAmount`. When user tries to send the maximum `shareAmount` to withdraw all the lent amount, notice that the amount withdrawable is limited to the `pos.underlyingAmount` (original depos

### Example 2: H-4: Lender force Loan become default

**Source**: Sherlock
**Protocol**: Cooler
**Impact**: HIGH

**Details**:

## Summary
in ```repay()``` directly transfer the debt token to Lender, but did not consider that Lender can not accept the token (in contract blacklist), resulting in repay() always revert, and finally the Loan can only expire, Loan be default

## Vulnerability Detail
The only way for the borrower to get the collateral token back is to repay the amount owed via repay(). Currently in the repay() method transfers the debt token directly to the Lender.
This has a problem:
 if the Lender is blacklisted by the debt token now, the debtToken.transferFrom() method will fail and the repay() method will always fail and finally the Loan will default.
Example:
Assume collateral token = ETH,debt token = USDC, owner = alice
1.alice call request() to loan 2000 usdc , duration = 1 mon
2.bob call clear(): loanID =1
3.bob transfer loan[1].lender = jack by Cooler.approve/transfer  
  Note: jack has been in USDC's blacklist for some reason before
or bob in USDC's blacklist for some reason now, it doesn't need transfer 'lender')
4.Sometime before the expiration date, alice call repay(id=1) , it will always revert, Because usdc.transfer(jack) will revert
5.after 1 mon, loan[1] default, jack call defaulted() get collateral token

```solidity
    function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external

### Example 3: [M-06] [Denial-of-Service] Contract Owner Could Block Users From Withdrawing Their Strike

**Source**: Code4rena
**Protocol**: Putty
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**Details**:

_Submitted by xiaoming90, also found by berndartmueller_

When users withdraw their strike escrowed in Putty contract, Putty will charge a certain amount of fee from the strike amount. The fee will first be sent to the contract owner, and the remaining strike amount will then be sent to the users.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L500>

```solidity
function withdraw(Order memory order) public {
	..SNIP..

	// transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
	if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
		// send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
		uint256 feeAmount = 0;
		if (fee > 0) {
			feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
			ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
		}

		ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);

		return;
	}
	..SNIP..
}
```

There are two methods on how the owner can deny user from withdrawing their strike amount from the contract

#### Method #1 - Set the `owner()` to `zero` address

Many of the token implementations do not allow transfer to `zero` address ([Reference](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-transfer-to-the-zero-address)). Popular ERC20 implementations such as the following Openzeppelin's ERC20 implementation do not allow transfer to `zero` address, and will revert immediately if the `to` address (recipient) points to a `zero` address d

### Example 4: [M-15] Malicious Stakers can grief Keepers

**Source**: Code4rena
**Protocol**: Backd
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**Details**:

_Submitted by sseefried_

A Staker -- that has their top-up position removed after `execute` is called by a Keeper -- can always cause the transaction to revert. They can do this by deploying a smart contract to the `payer` address that has implemented a `receive()` function that calls `revert()`. The revert will be triggered by the following [lines](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol#L727-L729) in `execute`

```solidity
if (vars.removePosition) {
    gasBank.withdrawUnused(payer);
}
```

This will consume some gas from the keeper while preventing them accruing any rewards for performing the top-up action.

### Proof of Concept

I have implemented a [PoC](https://github.com/sseefried/codearena-backd-2022-04/blob/4d3c3ba7a0139bea01a0bdee9e84a7921572a9fd/backd/tests/top_up_action/sseefried_test_staker_grief.py) in a fork of the contest repo. The attacker's contract can be found [here](https://github.com/sseefried/codearena-backd-2022-04/blob/4d3c3ba7a0139bea01a0bdee9e84a7921572a9fd/backd/contracts/AliceAttacker.sol).

### Recommend Mitigation Steps

To prevent this denial of service attack some way of blacklisting badly behaved Stakers should be added.

### Example 5: User's funds are locked temporarily in the PriorityPool contract

**Source**: Cyfrin
**Protocol**: Stake Link
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**Details**:

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:** The protocol intended to utilize the deposit queue for withdrawal to minimize the stake/unstake interaction with the staking pool.
When a user wants to withdraw, they are supposed to call the function `PriorityPool::withdraw()` with the desired amount as a parameter.
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {//@audit-info LSD token
    if (_amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    IERC20Upgradeable(address(stakingPool)).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);//@audit-info get LSD token from the user
    _withdraw(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```
As we can see in the implementation, the protocol pulls the `_amount` of LSD tokens from the user first and then calls `_withdraw()` where the actual withdrawal utilizing the queue is processed.
```solidity
function _withdraw(address _account, uint256 _amount) internal {
    if (poolStatus == PoolStatus.CLOSED) revert WithdrawalsDisabled();

    uint256 toWithdrawFromQueue = _amount <= totalQueued ? _amount : totalQueued;//@audit-info if the queue is not empty, we use that first
    uint256 toWithdrawFromPool = _amount - toWithdrawFromQueue;

    if (toWithdrawFromQueue != 0) {
        totalQueued -= toWithdrawFromQueue;
        depositsSinceLastUpdate += toWithdrawFromQueue;//@audit-info regard this as a deposit via the queue
    }

    if (toWithdrawFromPool != 0) {
        stakingPool.withdraw(address(this), address(this), toWithdrawFromPool);//@audit-info withdraw from

### Example 6: H-9: BlueBerryBank#withdrawLend will cause underlying token accounting error if soft/hard vault has withdraw fee

**Source**: Sherlock
**Protocol**: Blueberry
**Impact**: HIGH

**Details**:

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/33 

## Found by

## Summary

Soft/hard vaults can have a withdraw fee. This takes a certain percentage from the user when they withdraw. The way that the token accounting works in BlueBerryBank#withdrawLend, it will only remove the amount returned by the hard/soft vault from pos.underlying amount. If there is a withdraw fee, underlying amount will not be decrease properly and the user will be left with phantom collateral that they can still use.

## Vulnerability Detail

        // Cut withdraw fee if it is in withdrawVaultFee Window (2 months)
        if (
            block.timestamp <
            config.withdrawVaultFeeWindowStartTime() +
                config.withdrawVaultFeeWindow()
        ) {
            uint256 fee = (withdrawAmount * config.withdrawVaultFee()) /
                DENOMINATOR;
            uToken.safeTransfer(config.treasury(), fee);
            withdrawAmount -= fee;
        }

Both SoftVault and HardVault implement a withdraw fee. Here we see that withdrawAmount (the return value) is decreased by the fee amount.

        uint256 wAmount;
        if (address(ISoftVault(bank.softVault).uToken()) == token) {
            ISoftVault(bank.softVault).approve(
                bank.softVault,
                type(uint256).max
            );
            wAmount = ISoftVault(bank.softVault).withdraw(shareAmount);
        } else {
